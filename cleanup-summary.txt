Cleanup Summary:

Files removed from the codebase:
1. src/main/java/com/acme/ems/model/TempEmployeeDetails.java
   - Reason: Not used by any active class, contains only stub code with no actual implementation in use

2. src/main/resources/dev-config.yml
   - Reason: Not imported by any active profile, redundant with application.properties

3. target/classes/unused-dev-config.yml
   - Reason: Explicitly marked as unused, not referenced anywhere in the codebase

Target cleanup:
- Removed stale class files (OldPayrollController.class, PayrollService.class, TempEmployee.class)
- These appear to be from previous refactoring and are no longer needed

All core employee management functionality remains intact including:
- Employee creation, reading, updating, and deletion
- Payroll processing
- Employee archiving and cleanup jobs
- Audit logging
